I have also fallen for your smile which makes me giddy for no reason at all (or a lot actually). I've fallen for your silly and TOTALLY ORIGINAL jokes, which I remember randomly and just smile or burst into laughter at. I've fallen for how you make my day better, even if I wanted to cry a minute before. I've also fallen for every second I get to spend with you even if those leave me wanting more. Every moment with you feels like the sweetest story, and I can’t wait for all the chapters we’ll write together. 💖"},
      {day: 2, content: "Day 2: Writing this at 2 AM so might be a lil cliche but here goes nothing. I just wanna make you the happiest you've ever been. (No i did not steal this from horimiya i swear. i'm as original as you and your jokes :) I want to make you feel safe and loved and comforted. I want you to know that you can come to me when you're not ok, when your eyes are filled with tears and I'll hold you til you're a little more ok. I'm always here for you. I love you at your best and at your worst. Nothings gonna change that. Ours is one of those love stories ppl will talk abt for years to come bc we have something extraordinary(no like legit 2 years of lore is kinda crazy). You are not just my world, you're my everything. I'm here and I'm gonna keep being here every day for the rest of our lives. You truly are my home, my safe place, the love of my life. I want you to know that I sure as hell mean it when I say I'd do anything for you. I'd do absolutely anything. I love you now and I love you always. Everything is going to be okay. We are going to be okay. This will last as long as we choose each other and keep choosing each other for the rest our lives. And I have no doubt in my mind that we will. I love you. Really I do. With everything I have in me. I love you."},
      {day: 3, content: "Day 3: I wanna smush your face with kisses every five seconds, and then pretend like I didn’t just do that. I want you wrapped around me — arms, legs, thoughts, everything. I want you to feel so completely loved that there’s not a single second of doubt. I want to be your safest hug, your happiest thought, your silliest dance partner at 2AM. I wanna leave dumb little notes in your pockets but sadly it has to be online and hide behind doors just to say “boo” and then kiss you. I want to laugh so hard with you that our stomachs hurt, and cry with you when it gets too much, because you never have to be alone in anything. I want all the little moments with you — the movie rambles, the warm silences, the “omg taste this” bites, and the “come nap with me” tugs. You’re my person. You really are. And I love you so, so stupidly much. I miss you a lot today. So until I can hold you again, I’ll see you in your dreams (yes, even your drunk ones lol). Please remember I love you. Always. In all ways. Go enjoy your whiskey (don’t smoke or I’ll bite you like i did the first time)"},
      {day: 4, content: "Day 4: it genuinely doesn’t matter where we are or what we’re doing — when i’m with you, it just feels right. like the world goes quiet for a second and everything softens. even when my brain’s being loud or anxious or spinning out, something about you makes it all slow down. you make me feel worthy. like i actually matter. and that’s something i never really believed before you. i love the way you exist in this world, how you love, how you care, how you know exactly how to make me laugh even when i don’t want to smile. and you’re the feeling i imagined love would be like as a kid — just… warm, kind, and a little bit magical(except for when you said i was arya in that picture bitch 😞). time feels weird with you. it goes by so fast but also stretches, like the universe’s way of saying ‘stay here a little longer’. i don’t ever want it to stop. i love loving you. more than you love me, actually. i win <3"},
      {day: 5, content: "Day 5: i don’t think i ever just say ‘i love you’ casually. every time i say it, it’s because i need you to know — like really know — that you mean a lot to me. it’s not routine. it’s not filler. it’s a full-body feeling(quite literally now sorry i'm ovulating-), and it comes with everything i am. i’ll still choose you even on the days we don’t understand each other. even when we’re tired or distant or just off. there’s no one else i want to be soft for like this. i don’t crave attention from anyone else. just you. always you. i think about how it started — maybe it was how you laughed at the wrong parts of stories at times💀, or how you said things you didn’t realize would stay with me for weeks(good way promise LMAO). whatever it was, it got to me. and it hasn’t let go since. before you, i think i was just existing. and then suddenly everything had more weight, more color, more real ukwim. you didn’t fix everything, but you made life feel like something worth fixing. so if you ever feel alone, or unsure, or distant from me — just pause. i’m still here. even if it’s quiet. i’m still choosing you. i love you 🤍"},
      {day: 6, content: "Day 6: you always know exactly what to do. it’s like your hands have this secret language with my body that even i don’t fully understand. i think about that movie night all the time — lilo & stitch playing, but we couldn’t focus on a single frame LOL. we were tucked away at the end of the row in those stupidly comfortable lounge chairs, and all i could think about was how warm your hand felt resting on my thigh. you kept brushing it higher, slow enough that i could pretend not to notice, until i remember you saying, 'spread your legs wider.' gosh, do you KNOW what that did to me? i could feel my pulse in places i didn’t even know had one bro i died. or came alive idek. i went a little dizzy honestly. and you knew exactly what you were doing. the way you kissed me through it — bro you had me a whimpering mess LOL. i still feel it. the way you made my entire body ache and melt at the same time. it’s been playing on loop in my head since. i’m probably still ovulating as you’re reading this, btw. yup. that's the first horny letter i wrote it. see you at night ;) unless we're reading it together who knows."},
      {day: 7, content: "Day 7: you give me the kind of feelings people write novels about — but like, not the overhyped ones with dramatic monologues in the rain. more like the ones with weirdly specific playlists, characters who accidentally fall asleep on call, and random late-night walks where nothing happens but everything matters. that kind of love. you’re just… woven into everything now. i’ll be doing the most normal shit and suddenly i’m thinking of your laugh or something dumb you said that made me smile when i didn’t want to. it’s annoying actually. like who gave you permission to just exist in my brain rent free. but also don’t leave, okay? stay. you’re my favourite part of this story, and i hope we get a really, really long book."},
      {day: 8, content: "Day 8: when i tell people about you, they always say something like “no way he acts like that??” and i just laugh because yeah. not many really know this version of you that i get to love. the one who gets weirdly passionate about blocking the tubelight and saying 'wow omg solar eclipse' (pls get help, no i'm not the help 💀). the one who smiles like a little kid when he's proud of himself, even if he tries to hide it. you come off all put-together most of the time or atleast thats how i used to see you when we weren't as close, but i now see the softness. the gentleness. the parts you don't hand out to just anyone. and it makes me feel really reeeallly lucky. like i unlocked a secret level or something. i don't take that for granted. i don’t want the version of you the world claps for — i want the one who’s just a little bit of a mess but still tries, still shows up, still chooses me. that’s the side of you i’ll keep choosing too.

I don’t blame you. Sometimes it feels like that's the only way to survive. But before you fully retreat, I want to say something. Or maybe everything.\n\nI don’t know what it’s like to live inside your house. I don’t know the exact texture of your pain — the weight of her shrill voice, banging doors, withheld dinners, and the echo of \"it's your fault\" banging around inside your head.\n\nBut I do know this:\n\nThis is not your fault. It never was.\n\nNot your temper. Not your yelling. Not your inability to \"stay calm.\" Not your need to defend yourself, to scream back when someone pierces you with words. None of that makes you wrong. It makes you human.\n\nYou were a kid. You still are. And instead of being taught peace, you were dropped into a battlefield and expected to be the referee. That’s not fair. That’s never been fair.\n\nAnd somewhere in all this chaos, you started believing you were the spark that lit the fire. But baby, you were just trying to breathe through the smoke. They should have protected you. They should have seen your anger as a cry for help — not a cause of war. Your emotions aren't the problem. The war was already happening long before you ever raised your voice.\n\nAnd your cave? It’s not cowardice. It’s not weakness. It’s protection. I respect that. You’re allowed to go back there when everything around you becomes too loud, too much. But I hope you know this:\n\nI’ll wait outside your cave. Every time. I won’t push, but I’ll never leave.\n\nYou are not hard to love babe. You are not too much. You are not broken beyond repair.\n\nYou are someone with fire in his chest and softness in his bones. Someone who still dares to laugh and make silly references even when everything’s falling apart. Someone who still shows up, even when the world hasn’t been kind. That’s rare. That’s gold.\n\nYou think your dad is strong because he “controls” his emotions. But maybe real strength is feeling everything and still choosing to care. Maybe your anger is sacred — maybe it’s the only language your heart knows to say, “Please, someone just hear me.”\n\nWell, I hear you. I hear all of it.\n\nI know it hurts that every conversation with her ends in explosions. That even when you don’t want to scream, something inside you has to. That every normal moment — a night out with friends, a few minutes of joy — feels like a betrayal to someone in your house.\n\nBut baby, you’re allowed joy. You’re allowed rest. You’re allowed to have a life outside the mess. You deserve a love that doesn’t come with conditions, a home that doesn’t demand you shrink.\n\nAnd I’m so, so sorry that hasn’t been your reality.\n\nBut let this be your reminder:\n\nYou’re not what they made you believe you are. You are not a bomb, a trigger, a storm. You’re a boy trying to build peace in a house that forgot what silence even feels like. That’s a miracle. And it’s okay if you need to retreat. But please, while you're there — don’t turn your anger inward. Don’t let their dysfunction become your self-image.\n\nLet this letter wrap around you like armor. Let it echo inside your cave.\n\nYou are not your rage.\nYou are not the screaming.\nYou are not the fights.\nYou are not the reason.\nYou are not unlovable.\n\nYou are good. You are still good.\nAnd I will keep saying that until you believe it — and even after that.\n\nTake your time in the cave. But come back. Not for me — for you.\nBecause the world needs boys like you to stay alive, to keep going, to write better stories than the ones they were handed.\n\nAnd when you come back — I’ll be right here. Always. But rmemeber, respect goes both ways.\n\nWith more love than you know,\nme"},
